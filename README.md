## Project Structure & Technologies
Frontend Stack
React: The core JavaScript library for building the user interface.

HTML5 / CSS3: Structured content and modern styling (Note: Styling is defined in the external ./App.css file).

JavaScript (ES6+): For component logic, state management (useState, useEffect), and performance optimization (useCallback, useRef).

HTML Canvas: Used to render the dynamic Star Background effect for an engaging visual experience.
## 🌐 Deployment & The start Command
Based on the previous deployment logs you shared, the issue was likely a missing or incorrect Start Command.

If you are using a platform like Render for deployment, the platform needs a command to start the compiled production server.
